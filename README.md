## Description

Accelerometers have become an appealing alternative to self-report techniques for studying physical activity in observational studies and clinical trials, largely because of their relative objectivity. During observation periods, the devices measure electrical signals that are a proxy for acceleration. “Activity counts” are then devised by summarizing the voltage signals across a short period known as an epoch; one-minute epochs are common. Because accelerometers can be worn comfortably and unobtrusively, they produce around-the-clock observations of many kinds of activity.

The data for this project was collected on a 63 year-old male with BMI 25, who was admitted to the Advanced Cardiac Care Center of Columbia University Medical Center and diagnosed with congestive heart failure (CHF). He wore an accelerometerdevice that continuously recorded physical activity for several months. The goal of this study was to understand patterns of physical activity over long periods of time; more generally, it is hoped that trends that emerge prior to and happen right after adverse clinical eventsand can be potentially used for dynamic update of patient status.
