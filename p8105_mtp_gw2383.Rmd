## read and tidy data

```{r, cache = TRUE}
activity_df = 
  read_csv("./data/p8105_mtp_data.csv") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  mutate(day = factor(day, levels = c("Sunday", "Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday", "Saturday"))) %>% 
  arrange(week, day) # reordering the rows by 'day' to make it more readable
```

the data is collected across `r dim(activity_df)[1]` days (`r dim(activity_df)[1]/7` weeks), and each day we collected the activity data once per miniute (`r dim(activity_df)[2]-2` times per day)
